# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Bun TypeScript API Boilerplate team and community take security bugs seriously. To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/tu-usuario/bun-typescript-api-boilerplate/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Bun TypeScript API Boilerplate team will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ✅ Input validation with Valibot
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Token revocation system

### Known Security Limitations
- ⚠️ **In-memory storage**: Data is not persisted and lost on server restart
- ⚠️ **No rate limiting**: API endpoints are not rate-limited
- ⚠️ **No HTTPS enforcement**: HTTPS is not enforced in the current implementation
- ⚠️ **No request logging**: Security events are not logged
- ⚠️ **No session management**: Relies solely on JWT tokens
- ⚠️ **No input sanitization**: Basic validation only, no XSS protection
- ⚠️ **No CSRF protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection not implemented

### Security Best Practices for Production

If you plan to use this code in production, consider implementing:

1. **Database Security**
   - Use a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Regular database backups

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement refresh token rotation
   - Add session management
   - Implement account lockout policies
   - Add multi-factor authentication (MFA)

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Cloudflare)
   - Configure proper CORS policies

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Implement comprehensive input validation
   - Add XSS protection
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement CSRF protection

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Implement structured logging
   - Add security event logging
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Regular security audits

6. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Use container security best practices
   - Implement secrets management
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Use security scanning tools

### Dependencies Security

Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
bun audit

# Update dependencies
bun update
```

### Security Headers

Consider adding security headers in production:

```typescript
// Example security headers
res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
```
